# Refactor - Tractor

*Work on this project has slowed or stopped completely. Deadline 4/20/2021, 9pm MST.*

## Technologies Used

* `JavaScript`
* `HTML`
* `SCSS`
* `TDD`
* `ARIA`
* `Webpack`
* `JS Fetch() API`

## Overview

In this project we were given a pre-existing codebase to refactor & implement new technologies. Our main objectives were to use `fetch()` Web API calls for data manipulation, increase accessibility, make the file structure more modular, & use a CSS pre-processor.

## Goals & Objectives

* Build on top of existing code that no one on our team wrote
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve then manipulate data
* Refactor the code using modular, *DRY*, *SRP*
* Apply best practices for accessibility
* Leverage `Sass` to clean `CSS`
* Utilize Webpack to streamline all work flow

## Setup

1. Clone down this **Refactor-Tractor** repo
2. Using your command line, install dependencies using NPM by entering `npm install`
3. Get the local server going by running `npm start`
4. In a separate directory outside Refactor Tractor, clone down this [What's Cookin API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/whats-cookin-api)
5. Follow the instructions from the What's Cookin API to get the server active using `npm start` in command line
6. To view the page enter `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser

* To run the tests enter `npm test` in command line
* To run the linter enter `npm run lint` in command line

## Project Goals

* Fetch & manipulate API data from a server
* Refactor functions for improved readability
* Separate file structure for increased modularity
* Refactor `CSS` utilizing `Sass`, `normalize`
* App should be fully responsive
* Optimize accessibility to 100%
* Unit testing for classes

## Road Map
##### Future Iterations Should Include:

* A user log in
* Ability to POST data to the pantry
* A video of how to/we navigate through the app via keyboard and screen reader
* Improve UI/UX
* Increased separation of class methods
