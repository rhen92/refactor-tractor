#### A Chance To Find Out If You Have The Salt;

*Work on this project has slowed or stopped completely. Deadline 4/20/2021, 9pm MST.*

##Technologies Used

* `javaScript`
* `HTML`
* `Sass`
* `TDD`
* `ARIA`
* `Webpack`
* `Fetch`

## Goals & Objectives

* Build on top of existing code that no one on our team wrote
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve then manipulate data
* Refactor the code using modular, *DRY*, *SRP*
* Apply best practices for accessibility
* Leverage `Sass` to clean `CSS`
* Utilize Webpack to streamline all work flow

## Overview

This project offered a chance to dive into someone else's code as a team. Beyond implementing all our new technologies, we explored a new code base long enough to what it truly needed to function more fluidly.

## Setup

* Clone down this Refactor-Tractor repo
* Then install the library dependencies. Run:
```bash
npm install
```
* To review our code open in your text editor
* Run `npm start` in your terminal to start the server
* In another tab in your computer, clone down this [link here] repo as well
* Run `npm start` on that server as well
* To view the page to `http://localhost:8080/` to view the page
* To test the code open another tab in the Refactor Tractor file and run `npm test`

## Functionality Goals

* Fetch API data from a local server
* Proper POST error handling
* Fully functioning input fields on client-side interface
* Refactor for *DRY* all files
* Refactor for dynamic method use
* All `DOM` manipulation should be reorganized into its own `domUpdates.js` file
* Refactor `CSS` utilizing `Sass`, `normalize`
* App should be fully responsive to all screen sizes
* Optimize accessibility for UI/UX to as close to 100% as possible
* Robust happy/sad path testing suite
